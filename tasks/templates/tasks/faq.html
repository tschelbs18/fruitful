    <b>Q: What is Fruitful?</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    A: Fruitful is a productivity tool to help people stay organized and motivated while going through their daily tasks.
    You can create a list of the things you want to accomplish, and earn little rewards and points you set for yourself.

    <b>Q: How do I get started with Fruitful?</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    A: First, <a href="/register">register</a> an account if you are a new user, or if you already have an account <a href="/login">login</a> here.
    <br>
    Next, add some <a href="/tasks">tasks</a> to your daily to-do list and tell us how big of a lift that task will be.
    If it's easy, call it picking a grape. If it's a handful, call it an apple. If it's an armload, call it a watermelon. Don't worry, we'll reward you accordingly.
    <br>
    Then, add some rewards to stay motivated. If you do the work of harvesting, you should be able to enjoy the fruits of your labor (get it?).
    Grapes, apples, and watermelons are rewards for easy, medium, and hard tasks respectively. When you complete a task, you'll get an option to choose a reward,
    spin a random wheel, or take points instead.
    <br>
    Last, go ahead and enjoy your rewards. Or if you opted for points, take a look at the scoreboard for all-time or daily to see how you stack up.
    Remember, the points don't matter and we hope you have a fruitful day!
