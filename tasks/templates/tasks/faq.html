    <b>Q: How do I get started with Fruitful?</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    A: First, <a href="/register">register</a> an account if you are a new user, or if you already have an account <a href="/login">login</a> here.
    <br>
    Next, add some <a href="/tasks">tasks</a> to your daily to-do list and tell us how big of a lift that task will be.
    If it's easy, call it a grape. If it's a handful, call it an apple. If it's an armload, call it a watermelon. Don't worry, we'll reward you accordingly.
    <br>
    Then, add some <a href="/rewards">rewards</a> to stay motivated. If you do the work of harvesting, you should be able to enjoy the fruits of your labor (get it?).
    Grapes, apples, and watermelons are rewards for easy, medium, and hard tasks respectively. When you complete a task, you'll earn points which you can then redeem for rewards. We've
    filled out some basic options for rewards and you can add personalized ones for yourself to stay motivated.
    <br>
    Last, go ahead and enjoy your rewards or take a look at the scoreboard for all-time or daily productivity to see how you stack up.
    Remember, the points don't matter and we hope you have a fruitful day!
