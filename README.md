Fruitful Web App

Welcome to fruitful, a web application built to help with your productivity while using your computer. Our goal is for you to have a fruitful day by helping you to get sh*t done and have fun doing it.

The application is available for free in production at www.afruitfulday.com or www.fruitful6.herokuapp.com.

Users can register for an account using an email address and begin using the web app for productivity. We'll keep track of your tasks, let you assign types to them, and let you earn points for getting stuff done. Once you've earned some points, you can cash those points in for self-controlled rewards. We've preloaded some rewards for users but you can also add your own custom rewards to your personal rewards shop.

Feel free to continue using the App that way and check out the scoreboards to see how you stack up against other users.
Lastly, submit an error/feedback report if you encounter any issues and we'll look into it.

Hope you have a fruitful day!
